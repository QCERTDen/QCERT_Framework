# QCERT Framework

Initiated in November 2024 in response to the multi-tiered, multi-faceted challenges facing our community and the rapidly escalating threats posed to the safety and sanctuary of our community therein, the Denver chapter of the Queer Community Emergency Response Team (QCERT) was developed to create a well-trained civilian emergency volunteer force. These teams are vital to provide support for urgent situations when threats to well-being or self-determination, and autonomy or liberty are presented, whether against the individual or the community. QCERT operations provides community self-sufficiency through the development and maintenance of multi-functional response teams that, together, can unite and enrich the fractured support architectures of a community, organize them to deliver a holistic, measured response to the threat presented to the individual or the community, and empower the individual or community to maintain their well-being and self-determination as granted to them by their human rights. While the structure of QCERT resembles a traditional Community Emergency Response Team, this framework exists to outline the purpose and multi-functional roles within the association in lieu of governmental support and as tailored to the common needs of the Queer community under the association’s shared motto:

### Nos Nobis Protegimus - We Protect Us

# Purpose 

## Association 
The association exists to have a recognizable feature under which various operations are conducted. The name of this unincorporated, not for profit association shall be ”Queer Community Emergency Response Team (QCERT)” 

## Organization 
The purpose of the Queer Community Emergency Response Team is to create a specialized, well-trained civilian volunteer force focused on ensuring the safety, resilience, and autonomy of the queer community in times of crisis. QCERT aims to address both immediate and ongoing threats to the well-being, self-determination, and liberty of queer individuals and the community at large. QCERT serves to operate in the gaps presented by governmental bureaucratic reactivity.
