Objective Overview of QCERT

## Provide Immediate Support in Emergencies
QCERT is designed to respond to urgent situations where the queer community faces threats to safety, such as hate group activities, governmental deprivation of human rights, refugee crises, or other emergencies that may disproportionately impact LGBTQ+ individuals. This includes medical responses to civil unrest against the community, with security forces to ensure the safety of medical teams in the field, and crisis intervention therapists to help the community heal after hate group violence.

## Foster Community Self-Sufficiency
By building and maintaining multi-functional response teams through various roles, QCERT enhances the community's ability to respond to crises without relying solely on governmental intervention or fractured community support architecture. Promote general awareness to the capabilities and real community impacts of QCERT’s activities, along with publicly offered trainings on behalf of the org

## Organize Holistic, Collective Responses
QCERT’s structure allows it to organize a broad-based, cohesive response to threats. It brings together community members to form a united front to both reactively and proactively address the needs of the community. Establish a communications network and resource management portal to empower QCERT team leaders to operate independently, and request appropriate down-line activation.

## Empower Individuals and the Community
QCERT's operations emphasize the rights to self-determination, autonomy, and dignity, helping queer individuals and the broader community protect and assert these rights. Through training, preparedness, and community cohesion, QCERT empowers members to take control of their own safety and well-being. This includes the organization working with community event organizers to provide 1:1 deterrent countermeasures against hate groups who seek to disrupt community events, and procuring shelter for unhoused queer refugees who are in acute emergent need.

## Fill Gaps in Traditional Acute Support Frameworks 
Given that the needs of the queer community are often overlooked in traditional emergency response frameworks, QCERT provides a tailored, inclusive alternative that addresses specific vulnerabilities and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals. The deployment of this emergency response serves to meet the need where it is, rather than putting the responsibility solely on the shoulders of vulnerable individuals to defragment a fragmented system of support services.
