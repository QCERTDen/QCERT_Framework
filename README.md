# QCERT - A Model for Queer Community Readiness and Resilience

This framework was started as a group effort to become a manual by which at-risk communities can enable their safety, security, and longevity through collective action and mutual aid, guided by careful and concise planning. This group consists of professionals within their respective fields who answered a call to action in the presence of various existential threats to the Queer community with the hopes to create change through inspiring action in others, converting "we should", to "we did". As it stands, the originating QCERT exists within the Denver area and contains more than 50 members, led by a decentralized group of volunteers across all demographics working and planning for a common cause- the welfare of the Queer community.

The framework was developed under the actionable FEMA CERT model, modified to fit the various needs and demands required to build readiness into the Queer community on an individual, local, and community level. To meet this need, this framework contains: 

* Articles of organization
* Objective Overview
* Framework Definitions
* Key Organizaitonal Components
* Roles and Responsibilities for Teams
* Team Activation Terms

This repository for the framework will be updated to include in future updates:

* Team-Specific Operational Scope
* Digital Media Guide for Community Campaigns
* Tech Infrastructure Guides for Wide-Coverage Encrypted Communication Networks
* Platform-Agnostic Tech Infrastructure Guides for Decentralized Data Sharing
* Guidance for Engaging Data with Politicians
* Operational Security Guides for Data Security
