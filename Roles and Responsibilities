# Roles and Responsibilities

## Roles 

The roles which exist within QCERT serve to solve challenges cohesively, as such, the responsibilities which define each role’s functions should be appropriate to the mission and appropriate to serve the mission of the organization. Roles should be maintained in a manner as to determine yea/nay in votes for extended community activation, as such it pays to be mindful of the number of votes to be cast as each leader maintains delegatory responsibilities.

## Leadership Roles 
Those in leadership roles serve in an operational capacity to allocate, direct, develop, strategize, and improve for and on behalf of the QCERT organization in addition to serving in their role as a member.

## Responsibilities 
The responsibilities for the various roles serve to delineate functions between roles, but are not hard definitions for what functions one can or should serve. Responsibilities are to be shared as individual capacity allows, but one’s function denotes that individual’s specialty, and as such when responsibilities are shared, the individual’s role denotes them as a subject matter expert in their function. QCERT relies on collective brainstorming, aid, assistance, and empowerment. This framework’s purpose in delineating responsibilities is to define a baseline expectation for each role as defined above.
