Defining the Framework

The framework should be:

## Deployable

### Reachable by Any 
Any community, irrespective of its background needs to be enabled to start or establish and have a local chapter of QCERT. 

### Self-Reliance Oriented  
The framework can offer tools/structures that result in the sustainment of core operations with no or minimal dependability on a third party's support.  

### Operational Modularity  
The org should be nimble enough on the threat scenarios, community wants, and other resources

## Repeatable 

### Minimum Barriers to Deployment  
Clear, concise deployment plan is required without large training or specific expertise.  

### Portable & Agile 
Must be deployable in any number of various locations and social structures, even where the supporting infrastructure is lacking.  

### Cross-Community Adaptability  
Should allow adaptation for multiple communities while holding on to key principles

## Easy to Implement/ Maintain  

### Affordable Infrastructure
The infrastructure needed to support the organization should be free or low-cost, leveraging open-source tools, grassroots fundraising, and community donations.  

### Decentralized Financial Support 
The framework should cover the polities for nontraditional funding sources, including community sponsorship, mutual aid contributions, and skill-based resource sharing.  

### Barter & Resource Networks
Encouraging non-monetary exchange models allows acquiring necessary materials and services. Reasonable Investment in Shared Effort. 

### Equitable Workload Distribution 
Responsibilities must be clearly outlined to avoid burnout and ensure sustainability.  

### Task Delegation & Role Rotation
Designed-in flexibility so members can take time off or change roles without operations being interrupted.  

### Skill-Building & Training 
Ongoing education opportunities that equip members with needed competencies, such as first aid, crisis intervention, and security.

## Dynamically Scalable  

### Flexible Organizational Structure 
Capable of expanding and contracting depending on the number of active participants and the level of community need.  

### On-Demand Response Capabilities 
Rapid scaling-up of activities in the case of a sudden crisis or highly raised threats is important.  

### Distributed Leadership 
One that enables shared decision-making and decentralization â€“ thus preventing dependence upon a single leader or governing body.
